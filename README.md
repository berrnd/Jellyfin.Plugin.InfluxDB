# Jellyfin.Plugin.InfluxDB

This is a custom plugin for [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) to write user statistics/events to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/).

Please note that this depends on unofficial modifications, which can be found in [my personal fork of Jellyfin](https://github.com/berrnd/jellyfin).
